					<p style="font-size: 20px; font-family: 'Lora';">
						 If the first models were born in the 18th century, it is only at the end of the 19th century that the first real cars were put on the road.

							The automobile became a luxury object that people wanted to exhibit. It is in the Tuileries Park, in France, in 1898 that the big car shows were born. Only cars that could travel the distance Paris-Versailles-Paris were accepted in the show.

							After the First World War, mass-produced cars gradually became available to a wider public. In the 1930s, automobile tourism expanded. In the United States, thousands of families went into debt to buy a car. In the 1950s, very cheap models were produced and sold by the thousands.Today, the car represents the status of the individual who owns it. 

							LET'S LOOK AT SOME EXAMPLES :

							MERCEDES-BENZ 
							Born in 1886, it is in the 70's that its best seller, the 107 convertible appears in series such as Dallas. The new S class makes its appearance, the W126 series, the biggest success of Mercedes-Benz in the world of luxury cars. 

							LAMBORGHINI
							In 1963, Ferrucci Lamborghini launched Automobili Lamborghini: a company dedicated to producing prestigious, sporty and reliable cars. He wished to satisfy his passion with his fortune earned by the construction of his agricultural tractors. He managed to make a fortune in only 10 years. For an Aventador, it is necessary to spend 360 000 euros.
